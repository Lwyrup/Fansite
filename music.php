	<h2>Musical Career</h2>
	
	<p class="mhis" >Humble beginnings in a band called <span class="italic">Soil
	</span> was the origin point for <span class="bold">Serj Tankian</span>. In 
	<span class="italic">Soil</span>, it was <span class="bold"> Serj Tankian</span>
	on vocals and keyboard, his friend <span class="bold">Daron Malakian</span> 
	on vocals and lead guitar, <span class="bold"> Dave Hakopyan</span> on bass, 
	and <span class="bold">Domingo Laranio</span> on drums. <span class="bold">
	Shavo Odadjian</span> was the manager, but soon joined the band as rhythm 
	guitarist. <span class="bold">Hakopyan</span> and <span class="bold">Laranio
	</span> came to feel as if <span class="italic">Soil</span> wasn’t going 
	anywhere so they left the band, leading to the band splitting. In 1994, from
	the remnants of <span class="italic">Soil</span> <span class="bold">Serj 
	Tankian, Daron Malakian, and Shavo Odadjian</span> formed <span class="italic">
	System of a Down</span>, whose named was based off one of Daron’s poems, 
	<span class="bold">John Dolmayan</span> would soon join.  </p>

	<h2>System of a Down</h2>
	
	<p class="mhis" >Playing in local rock clubs and parties the group began 
	to grow a large following, although it wouldn’t be until 1998 that the band 
	released their first album. <span class="italic">System of a Down</span>, the
	self-titled first album from the band, had a total of 13 tracks with a runtime
	 of 40 minutes 36 seconds. The songs <span class="italic">“Sugar”</span> and 
	<span class="italic">“Spiders”</span> were radio favorites and soon aired, with 
	music videos, on MTV. Reception of the album was good and two years later the 
	album would be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.</p>
	
	<p class="mhis" >In 2001 the band’s second album <span class="italic">Toxicity</span>
	was released and <span class="bold">reached number one</span> on American and 
	Canadian charts. Many songs were politicly loaded but seemed to work out in the wake
	 of the September 11th attacks, seeing as it remained number 1 throughout that week. 
	<span class="italic">Toxicity</span> included 14 tracks lasting 44 minutes 1 second 
	and songs like <span class="italic">“Chop Suey”, “Toxicity”</span> which are some of
	the bands more well-known tracks, <span class="italic">“Chop Suey”</span> would even 
	earn a Grammy nomination. <span class="bold">The album has sold 12 million copies 
	worldwide and is considered their most successful albums.</span></p>
	
	<p class="mhis" >In early 2002 medium quality mp3 files named Toxicity II were 
	released on the internet, the rough workings of their third album. The band was 
	displeased fans were hearing unfinished low quality material and would 
	inspire the title of the third album <span class="italic">Steal This Album</span>. 
	16 tracks lasting 43 minutes 22 seconds came in a blank cd case and on the disc 
	itself, the album title appearing to be written in bootleg fashion. Released in 
	2002 the albums appearance is a reference to the leaking of the Toxicity II tracks 
	earlier that year. Despite not being too popular both <span class="bold">Serj 
	Tankian</span> and <span class="bold">John Dolmayan</span> have said it is their 
	favorite album.</p>
	
	<img src="images/soad-band.jpg" alt="members of System" width=400 id="soad">
	
	<p class="mhis" >May 17, 2005 <span class="italic">Mesmerize</span>, their fourth 
	album, released to favorable reviews and topped the charts as System’s second 
	number one album. Within the first week 800,000 copies sold worldwide and debuted 
	at number one in 12 countries. Mesmerize lasted 36 minutes 6 seconds with 11 
	tracks, including <span class="bold"><span class="italic">“B.Y.O.B.”</span> which 
	won a Grammy in 2006 for Best Hard Rock Performance.</span></p>
	
	<p class="mhis" >Part two of their double album was released shortly after part 
	one, which was Mesmerize. So, November 22, 2005 the band release their fifth 
	album <span class="italic">Hypnotize</span> and <span class="bold">debuted 
	number one for the second time that year.</span> For the album 
	<span class="italic">Hypnotize</span> <span class="bold">Daron Malakian</span> 
	ended up taking a more dominant role and wrote much of the material. 
	<span class="italic">Hypnotize</span> lasted 39 minutes 40 seconds with 12 tracks 
	and was much more somber than the previous albums. In 2006 the band went on 
	hiatus, unsure for how long, but they assured fans <span class="italic">
	<span class="bold">"We'll be back. We just don't know when." -Daron Malakian.
	</span></span></p>
	
	<p class="mhis">In late 2010 following rumors the band announced they would be 
	reuniting and touring. They toured all over and sold out often. Except for one 
	concert held April 23, 2015 to commemorate the Armenian Genocide in their home 
	country of Armenia where tickets were free. Currently as of 2016 the band is 
	working on their sixth studio album.</p>
	
	<h2>Solo works</h2>
	
	<p class="mhis" >After 2006 with the band on hiatus <span class="bold">Serj</span> 
	began working on solo projects and October 22, 2007 he released 
	<span class="italic">Elect the Dead</span> opening at number four in the United 
	States. Rather than the hard rock sound he was known for, he began messing with 
	more classical styles. <span class="italic">Elect the Dead</span> featured 12 tracks
	lasting 45 minutes and 3 seconds.</p>
	
	<p class="mhis" >Then in 2010 <span class="bold">Serj Tankian</span> released 
	his second solo work <span class="italic">Imperfect Harmonies</span>, an album 
	<span class="bold">Serj</span> says is more philosophical and abstract. Reviews 
	were mixed, but generally favorable, it left some critics feeling it was too
	much of a departure and others enjoyed it still. Runtime of the album was 44
	minutes 09 seconds for its 11 songs.</p>
	
	<p class="mhis" >Third album, titled <span class="italic">Harakiri</span>, was 
	released July 2012 and is the most up tempo punk rock album <span class="bold">
	Serj</span> has written. The album’s title <span class="italic">Harakiri</span> 
	refers to the honorable ritualistic suicide of the Japanese samurai and explores 
	ideas of animal suicide and environmentalism. Runtime of 45 minutes and 18 seconds
	for 11 songs.</p>
	
	<img src="images/serj-hara.jpg" alt="Serj in promotion for Harakiri" id="serj-hara" height="240">

	<p class="mhis" ><span class="italic">Orca Symphony No.1</span>, <span class="bold">
	Serj’s</span> next album, was released June 2013 and is a classical symphony 
	experiment that he always wanted to try. <span class="italic">Orca</span> is 
	structured into four parts and is the result of his classical experimentation
	on his first two solo albums. The four acts last 34 minutes in total and an
	amazing addition to his works.</p>

	<p class="mhis" >Next month, July 2013, <span class="bold">Serj</span> released 
	another experimental album titled <span class="italic">Jazz-Iz-Christ</span>. 
	Classic jazz and progressive elements define the album, which as you can guess is 
	Jazz. It surprisingly has 15 tracks and lasts 56 minutes 32 seconds. 
	<span class="bold">Tankian</span> has no announced solo albums lined up seeing how
	System of a Down is back together.</p>
