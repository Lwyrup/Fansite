	<h2>Political Presence and Activism</h2>
	
	<p class="bio-text"><span class="bold">Tankian</span> is an outspoken activist, who is passionate
	about human rights, recognition of genocides, and social justice. Following the
	September 11th attacks, he wrote an essay where he says <span class="italic">
	<span class="bold">"If we carry out bombings on Afghanistan or elsewhere
	to appease public demand, and very likely kill innocent civilians along 
	the way, we'd be creating many more martyrs going to their deaths in 
	retaliation against the retaliation. As shown from yesterday's events, you 
	cannot stop a person who's ready to die."</span></span> War is one of 
	his topics seeing how many innocent people are affected. such as the two 
	genocides in each world war that affected an estimated 7.5million people. 
	Many of these topics can be seen in his music such as<span class="italic"> 
	“prison system” </span>   where the lyrics are as follows.</p>
	
	<p class="lyrics"><span class="italic"> “…All research and successful drug policies show
	That treatment should be increased…”</span></p>
	
	<p class="bio-text">Despite the song being one of the more strangely written songs, it is 
	easy to get a sense of his stance on the issue. His lyrics can be strangely
	written, make little to no apparent sense, or reference important events. 
	<span class="italic"> Harakiri</span>   the song from the album of the 
	same title includes the following.</p>

	<img src="images/harakiri.jpeg" alt="Cover of Harakiri" id="cover-hara" width="300">
	
	<p class="lyrics"><span class="italic"> “…We're the greying herds<br>
	Hurting each other with our lives<br>
	Within our dreams, we all wake up<br>
	To kiss the ones who are born to die<br>
	Born to die, born to die<br><br>
	The drum fish<br>
	They beached themselves in Hara-kiri<br>
	The blackbirds<br>
	They fell in thousands from the sky<br>
	Their red wings<br>
	Streaming down from the higher seas<br>
	Deflected by the grounds…”</span></p>
	
	<p class="bio-text">In the first stanza, he talks about all of us as the greying herds and how
	we hurt each other by living. I believe he is referring to our impact on the
	planet such as emissions, how we have endangered animals, and so on. That is
	my interpretation but the second part isn’t as subjective, it refers to an 
	incident where red-winged black birds began dropping from the sky. 
	<span class="bold">5,000 birds laid dead</span> and necropsies show they 
	died on blunt force trauma and not something such as poisoning. <span class="bold">
	Tankian</span>  co-created a non-profit organization called Axis of 
	Justice to help try and change the world he lyrically commented on often.</p>
	
	<p class="bio-text"><span class="bold"> Serj</span>  has organized many protests from Armenian
	Genocide recognition to Axis of Justice protests. He also has taken on
	supporting animal rights after being disgusted with the industrial slaughter
	houses and has signed a PETA petition against the methods used in KFC slaughter
	houses.</p>
