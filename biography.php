	<p class="bio-text"><span class="bold">Serj Tankian</span> was born to his Armenian 
	parents August 21, 1967 in Beirut, Lebanon. They lived there until 1975, 
	when the Lebanese Civil War was just beginning. The family relocated to the 
	United States, specifically Los Angeles, California. There was already an 
	Armenian community there and <span class="bold">Serj</span> says that <span class="bold">
	growing up in that community</span> and seeing the denial of the Armenian genocide
	in such a country was what <span class="bold">made him such an avid activist.</span></p>
	
	<p class="bio-text"><span class="bold">Tankian</span> went to school at Rose 
	and Alex Pilibos Armenian School, and later went to California State University. 
	Marketing was his study at CSU and he started his own software company, albeit 
	short lived. During this time, he began playing with instruments and writing songs. 
	<span class="bold">Serj</span> and his three Armenian-American friends 
	<span class="bold">Daron Malakian</span>, <span class="bold">John Dolmayan</span>
	, and <span class="bold">Shavo Odadjian</span> would eventually become rock stars.</p>
	
	<p class="bio-text"><span class="bold">System of a Down</span> launched the boys
	into stardom, especially <span class="bold">Serj Tankian</span> the front man.
	Their songs reflect <span class="bold">Serj's</span> activist passion, with songs 
	addressing topics such as the War on Terror, genocide, overpopulation, the 
	American prison system, and environmentalism. To this day <span class="bold">
	Serj</span> is still passionate about the injustices of the world.</p>
	
	<p class="bio-text">June 9, 2012 <span class="bold">Tankian</span> married his
	longtime girlfriend, <span class="bold">Angela Madatyan</span>,in California.
	A little more than two years later the couple announced they had their first
	child a boy named <span class="bold">Rumi</span> in New Zealand.</p>
